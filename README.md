<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
<p>This project was built as an academic assignment for the module <em>Information Systems</em>, where our professor,<strong>Essaid El Bachari</strong>, tasked us with developing a pizzeria management system. The system aims to generate invoices for orders placed by customers.</p>

<p>We created a comprehensive management system for <strong>Lucas Pizzeria</strong>, which includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Supplier Management:</strong> Handling the details and interactions with suppliers.</li>
  <li><strong>Employee Management:</strong> Managing the staff and their roles within the pizzeria.</li>
  <li><strong>Menu and Ingredient Management:</strong> Overseeing the menu items and the ingredients used to prepare the dishes.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Management:</strong> Processing customer orders efficiently.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Management:</strong> Managing the logistics of delivering orders to customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Keeping track of customers who request delivered orders.</li>
</ul>

<p>This system integrates various operational aspects of the pizzeria to ensure smooth and efficient management.</p>
